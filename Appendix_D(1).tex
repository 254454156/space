\section*{Appendix D. Global AIC Comparison Across 25 Key SPARC Galaxies}

Table D1 lists the 17 low–surface–brightness (LSB) galaxies where SNUT decisively
outperforms zero‑parameter halo models, together with four high–surface–brightness (HSB)
galaxies whose bulge mass is allowed one self‑consistent scaling parameter, and four HSB
control galaxies. A positive $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}$ indicates preference for SNUT.

Across this focused sample, SNUT achieves $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}>10$ against the Burkert–Flat
model in 17/17 LSB systems and in 2/4 HSB systems (after bulge scaling), while the
core–NFW–LCDM profile never outperforms SNUT in any LSB galaxy.
Figures D3–D27 provide the corresponding rotation‑curve overlays.
